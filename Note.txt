1. src (source code)

we made this folder in which we have :

package is nothing but a folder 
we want to treat src as a local package

1. _init_.py -> we have to make this file as it is as convention given by python
                if we want to use src as a local package

                It would be treated as local package only when it has _init_.py 

2. mcq_gen -> we will keep our entire mcq_gen code here
