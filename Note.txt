1. src (source code)

we made this folder in which we have :

package is nothing but a folder 
we want to treat src as a local package

1. _init_.py -> we have to make this file as it is as convention given by python
                if we want to use src as a local package

                It would be treated as local package only when it has _init_.py 

2. mcq_gen -> we will keep our entire mcq_gen code here


Ways to install the requirement

if we want all the requirements to be installed

        pip install -r requirements.txt

For the set up 

1.  pip install setup.py 

           or

2. write -e . in the requirements.txt and 
    it will automatically install the local package by seeing which folder is having
    _init_.py in it
